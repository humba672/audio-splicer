Audio splitter by sentences

This is a program I made that divides an audio file into many short clips, divided at every sentence. To use it, you simply add the path of your audio file, write in the gap in miliseconds that defines a sentence (unless you really know what you're doing I reccomend 700), and then run it. A few notes: the files in the output directory get overwriten in every run, so if you have multiple files, copy the folder somewhere else after every run. If you get an error, you either forgot to set a path, a delay, or the file is not compatible. I'm working on fixing that last error, but for now I simply have no idea why it happens.
